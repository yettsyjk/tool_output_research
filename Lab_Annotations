### On the terminal, create a test file and view the permissions running ls -l:
touch test.txt
ls -al test.txt

### On the terminal, change user to admin, switch directory as shown below and list the content. Two directories will be losred

su admin
cd /home/admin/Desktop
ls

The permissions of a file or directory can be changed either using explicit annotation or through the octal notation method. The first method sets the permissions using the following modifiers:

● u - owner

● g - group

● o - other users

● a - all users

To allow user admin to read the guest_notes.txt file, use o+r to change file permissions. The command needs to be run with sudo because the permissions are being changed by a user that does not own the file.

sudo chmod o+r guest_notes.txt
ls ‑al
cat guest_notes.txt | tee ~/guest_permissions.txt
